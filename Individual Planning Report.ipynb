    "<h1>4) Methods and Plan</h1>\n",
    "<h3>Proposed Method: K-NN Classification</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>Q: Why is this method appropriate?</i> <br><br>\n",
    "Our problem is a binary classification task, as we are only predicting true or false. Given our small number of predictors and strong dataset size, K-NN is computationally feasible, and requires few assumptions about the underlying data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>Q: Which assumptions are required, if any, to apply the method selected?</i> <br><br>\n",
    "K-NN is highly sensitive to the scale of features. Because distance is calculated using variables like <code>Age</code> (range ~9-58) and <code>played_hours</code> (range ~0-223), an unstandardized analysis of this data would make the <code>played_hours</code> variable dominate the distance calculation. Thus, we <strong>must</strong> normalize/scale all quantitative features to a similar range.\n",
    "\n",
    "<i> Q: What are the potential limitations or weaknesses of the method selected?</i> <br><br>\n",
    "We must choose an optimal *K* value, which can be tricky. A poor choice of *K* can lead to overfitting or underfitting, resulting in a weaker model. Another weakness arises when considering the opportunity cost of using K-NN: it doesn't produce a simple \"model\" (like regression coefficients), making it slightly less interpretable in terms of which features are most important.\n",
    "\n",
    "<i> Q: How are you going to compare and select the model?</i> <br><br>\n",
    "We will tune *K* using 10-fold cross-validation on the training set. After testing on a range of *K* values (starting off with a range akin to 1-30), we can determine the strongest model by picking the *K* value with highest mean cross-validation accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "<i> Q: How are you going to process the data to apply the model? For example: Are you splitting the data? How? How many splits? What proportions will you use for the splits? At what stage will you split? Will there be a validation set? Will you use cross validation?</i> <br><br>\n",
    "First, split the <code>players.csv</code> data into a training set (80% of data) and a test set (20% of data) using <code>initial_split</code>. Now that the data is split, we can define a recipe, and convert <code>subscribe</code> to a factor (it is the response variable!). Scale and center our data to prevent variables from having more weight in the voting process of K-NN. <br><br>\n",
    "Next, define a K-NN model specification using <code>nearest_neighbor()</code>, setting <code>mode = \"classification\"</code> and <code>neighbors = tune()</code> to mark *K* for tuning. Combine the recipe and the model into a workflow, then begin tuning with <code>tune_grid()</code> and 10 cross-validation folds of the training data. After finding the best *K*, test the model's accuracy on the unseen test set, and report the accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix for a full picture of its performance.\n"
